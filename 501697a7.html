Secret Police Lowering Iron Curtain on Internet

			<div class="itemAbstract"><p>by Julie Moffett, Index on Censorship Online, 1998, October 5<BR> A Russian Internet expert says Russia&#39;s secret police are poised to implement a regulation that will permit them to monitor all electronic mail and Internet communications in the country without having to show a warrant.</p></div>
			<div class="itemDate">05.10.1998</div>
		</div>
			<div class="pageText"><p><font face="Arial">A Russian Internet expert says Russia&#39;s secret police are
poised to implement a regulation that will permit them to monitor all electronic
mail and Internet communications in the country without having to show a
warrant.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Anatoly Levenchuk, the webmaster of a special site devoted
to educating the public about the new regulation, told RFE/RL in a telephone
interview from Moscow that he is exposing the regulation, code-named SORM-2, as
an attempt by the secret police to return to totalitarian-style tactics.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says SORM-2 - which stands for &#39;systems for
ensuring investigative activity&#39; - is an enhancement of SORM-1, a regulation
already in place in Russia. According to Levenchuk, SORM-1, permits surveillance
of specific electronic mail or Internet communication, but only after officials
petition the courts for a warrant.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says SORM-2 will permit the FSB - the successor
to the KGB - to bypass the need for a warrant and thus be able to monitor, at
will, the electronic mail and Internet correspondence of anyone using a Russian
Internet service provider.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says the SORM-2 regulation requires all Russian
Internet and network providers to install a so-called &#39;black box,&#39; or special
surveillance device, in their main computers and devote a high-speed line
directly to each local FSB department.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk adds that the FSB will then monitor the
information &#39;as needed and silently,&#39; without the Internet providers even
knowing what material the FSB is reviewing.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Says Levenchuk: &#39;There should be witnesses or some
oversight of SORM-2.For example, there should be an electronic log of all FSB
activity which is accessible to other people so they can see what the FSB is
doing.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately there is no discussion of any oversight. The
FSB wants their surveillance to be silent, without witnesses and without
warrants. And I am afraid of that.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">What is even more alarming, says Levenchuk, is that SORM-2
will be a regulation, not legislation. Therefore, it will not face review or
discussion in the Duma or by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Levenchuk
explains: &#39;This regulation will have status of a ministerial act, and needs only
to be approved by the Minister of Justice.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Moreover, the regulation will originate in Goskomsviaz
(State Committee of Telecommunications), not even in the FSB. The act, however,
is sufficient enough to force this regulation on all Internet providers. Because
in order for the providers to get a license, they must submit forms to
Goskomsviaz that have been signed by FSB and show they meet all the requirements
necessary.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says FSB officials notified several of the major
Internet providers of the forthcoming regulation by summoning them to a meeting
and asking for their input.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Says Levenchuk: &#39;Several Internet providers go to this
room where five or six FSB agents are waiting for them. The providers are
completely silent when presented with SORM-2. I mean, this is a normal situation
for us in Russia when a dictator asks for advice. After all, any dictator will
listen only to advice he wants to hear. So, the providers made no comment and,
in fact, even agreed to the new proposal. I&#39;m not criticizing them for doing
this. Their business depends on FSB support. If FSB doesn&#39;t like their behavior,
they simply write a note to Goskomsviaz and their license is pulled or
suspended.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says the FSB justified SORM-2 by saying it is
necessary in order to fight organized crime, electronic fraud, and tax evasion.
The argument is absurd, says Levenchuk, because the mafia, and those wealthy
enough to engage in tax evasion and the sort, will use special programs to
encrypt their messages or simply dial long distance to a neighboring country and
use a non-Russian Internet provider.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Adding insult to injury, says Levenchuk, is that the FSB
is requiring Russian Internet providers to foot the bill for SORM-2. He says it
will cost the service providers about 1,000 dollars per month for a devoted line
to the FSB, and a one-time fee of about 5,000 dollars for computer software to
run the black box.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Other unknown costs include maintenance and upgrades to
the software, which Levenchuk estimates may be required every six months. He
adds that there will also be a bureaucratic burden, although the extent of which
is still unknown since the FSB hasn&#39;t said exactly how the provider will be
involved in the investigative process.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says this cost will probably be passed on to the
user. He estimates that after SORM-2 is implemented, it will raise the cost of
using the Internet in Russia by about 10 percent and likely put many of the
smaller Internet providers out of business.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk says he has heard rumors that SORM-2 will be
implemented in September.Even worse, Levenchuk fears it &#39;cannot be stopped now.&#39;
He adds: &#39;I think it will be enacted. I do not know what to do to stop it.
People here in Russia do not have a long tradition of freedom. I think none of
the SORM enactors understand how deeply they are violating freedoms, civil
rights and the law. Nor do the providers, or clients of the providers,
understand what precise rights will be violated by SORM. All I can do is put the
information on my web page and hope people see what is being done in my
country.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk seems to have been successful in getting the
word out. When contacted by RFE/RL, Barry Steinhardt, spokesman for the Global
Internet Liberty Campaign - a coalition of international organizations
supporting free speech on the Internet - said that SORM-2 is a &#39;return to the
bad old days of the KGB&#39; in Russia.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Said Steinhardt: &#39;[The secret police] wants to be able to
monitor all electronic mail in order - they say - to get access to a few pieces.
But given the history of Russia&#39;s misuse of the state security agencies, there
is absolutely no reason to believe they will restrict their snooping to a few
bad actors.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">The Internet Society - an international, non-profit
organization that focuses on standards, education, and policy issues regarding
the Internet - issued a statement to RFE/RL which says: &#39;One of the key
principles of the Internet Society is that on-line free expression is not
restricted by excessive governmental or private controls over computer hardware
or software, telecommunications infrastructure, or other essential components of
the Internet. We support all honest attempts to combat terrorism and other
criminal activity. But the Internet should not be used to police activities.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Even Internet-savy individuals in countries neighboring
Russia are outraged. Mikhail Doroshevich, who lives in Belarus and is the
webmaster for Internews Russia, told RFE/RL that he believes SORM not only
violates the Russian constitution, but is an indication that democracy is not so
alive and well in Russia.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Says Doroshevich: &#39;The vital point here is to oppose the
idea of such censorship and violation of the rights of individuals. The users
will, certainly, try to hide information. But why should that have to occur to
the majority of loyal citizens? It again pushes people to be dishonest and
undermines their trust of the government since it violates the right to
confidentiality of correspondence and intrudes into the private lives of
citizens.&#39;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Levenchuk agrees. He says SORM-2 will have a negative
effect on Internet development as a whole in Russia by causing foreigners to
avoid Russian Internet providers and discouraging regular Russian citizens from
using the Internet.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Says Levenchuk: &#39;The Internet is a network of trust. But
SORM-2 will be an invisible curtain of distrust. It will be like an electronic
iron curtain between Russia and all others.&#39;</font></p></div>
