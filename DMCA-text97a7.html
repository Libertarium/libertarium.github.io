  to the copyright ownership being transferred that are required by the
  applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the transferee shall be
  subject to the obligations under each such assumption agreement to make
  residual payments and provide related notices, accruing after the effective
  date of the transfer and applicable to the exploitation of the rights
  transferred, and any remedies under each such assumption agreement for breach

  protected design.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(d) ACTS IN ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS- A
  person who incorporates into that person&#39;s product of manufacture an
  infringing article acquired from others in the ordinary course of business, or
  who, without knowledge of the protected design embodied in an infringing
  article, makes or processes the infringing article for the account of another
  person in the ordinary course of business, shall not be deemed to have
  infringed the rights in that design under this chapter except under a
  condition contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b). Accepting an

  this section, an `infringing article&#39; is any article the design of which has
  been copied from a design protected under this chapter, without the consent of
  the owner of the protected design. An infringing article is not an
  illustration or picture of a protected design in an advertisement, book,
  periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast, motion picture, or similar
  medium. A design shall not be deemed to have been copied from a protected
  design if it is original and not substantially similar in appearance to a
  protected design.</blockquote>

  any action or proceeding under this chapter who alleges rights under this
  chapter in a design shall have the burden of establishing the design&#39;s

  identical to such design, or so similar as to make prima facie showing that
  such design was copied from such work.</blockquote>

  It is not an infringement of the exclusive rights of a design owner for a
  person to reproduce the design in a useful article or in any other form solely
  for the purpose of teaching, analyzing, or evaluating the appearance,
  concepts, or techniques embodied in the design, or the function of the useful
  article embodying the design.</blockquote>

  case in which the design was made within the regular scope of the designer&#39;s
  employment and individual authorship of the design is difficult or impossible
  to ascribe and the application so states, the name and address of the employer
  for whom the design was made may be stated instead of that of the individual
  designer.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(h) PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN- The
  application for registration shall be accompanied by two copies of a drawing
  or other pictorial representation of the useful article embodying the design,

</p><blockquote>`(i) DESIGN IN MORE THAN ONE USEFUL ARTICLE-
  If the distinguishing elements of a design are in substantially the same form
  in different useful articles, the design shall be protected as to all such
  useful articles when protected as to one of them, but not more than one

  applications filed under this chapter, similar protection to that provided
  under this chapter shall have that same effect as if filed in the United
  States on the date on which the application was first filed in such foreign
  country, if the application in the United States is filed within 6 months
  after the earliest date on which any such foreign application was

  under this chapter, and, if so, the Register shall register the design.
  Registration under this subsection shall be announced by publication. The date
  of registration shall be the date of publication.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(b) REFUSAL TO REGISTER; RECONSIDERATION-
  If, in the judgment of the Administrator, the application for registration
  relates to a design which on its face is not subject to protection under this
  chapter, the Administrator shall send to the applicant a notice of refusal to
  register and the grounds for the refusal. Within 3 months after the date on
  which the notice of refusal is sent, the applicant may, by written request,
  seek reconsideration of the application. After consideration of such a
  request, the Administrator shall either register the design or send to the
  applicant a notice of final refusal to register.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(c) APPLICATION TO CANCEL REGISTRATION- Any
  person who believes he or she is or will be damaged by a registration under
  this chapter may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, apply to the
  Administrator at any time to cancel the registration on the ground that the
  design is not subject to protection under this chapter, stating the reasons
  for the request. Upon receipt of an application for cancellation, the
  Administrator shall send to the owner of the design, as shown in the records
  of the Office of the Administrator, a notice of the application, and the owner
  shall have a period of 3 months after the date on which such notice is mailed
  in which to present arguments to the Administrator for support of the validity
  of the registration. The Administrator shall also have the authority to
  establish, by regulation, conditions under which the opposing parties may
  appear and be heard in support of their arguments. If, after the periods
  provided for the presentation of arguments have expired, the Administrator
  determines that the applicant for cancellation has established that the design
  is not subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall order
  the registration stricken from the record. Cancellation under this subsection
  shall be announced by publication, and notice of the Administrator&#39;s final
  determination with respect to any application for cancellation shall be sent

  public, if earlier than the date of filing of the application, and shall
  contain a reproduction of the drawing or other pictorial representation of the
  design. If a description of the salient features of the design appears in the
  application, the description shall also appear in the certificate. A

</p><blockquote>`(b) REVIEW OF REFUSAL TO REGISTER- (1)
  Subject to paragraph (2), the owner of a design may seek judicial review of a
  final refusal of the Administrator to register the design under this chapter

  the design subject to protection under this chapter, enforce the rights in
  that design under this chapter.</blockquote>

  Administrator may, at the Administrator&#39;s option, become a party to the action
  with respect to the issue of registrability of the design claim by entering an
  appearance within 60 days after being served with the complaint, but the
  failure of the Administrator to become a party shall not deprive the court of
  jurisdiction to determine that issue.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(d) USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTE-
  The parties to an infringement dispute under this chapter, within such time as
  may be specified by the Administrator by regulation, may determine the
  dispute, or any aspect of the dispute, by arbitration. Arbitration shall be
  governed by title 9. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to
  the Administrator, and such award shall, as between the parties to the
  arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The arbitration
  award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this
  subsection shall preclude the Administrator from determining whether a design

  claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement. In addition, the
  court may increase the damages to such amount, not exceeding $50,000 or $1 per
  copy, whichever is greater, as the court determines to be just. The damages
  awarded shall constitute compensation and not a penalty. The court may receive
  expert testimony as an aid to the determination of damages.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>`(b) INFRINGER&#39;S PROFITS- As an alternative
  to the remedies provided in subsection (a), the court may award the claimant
  the infringer&#39;s profits resulting from the sale of the copies if the court
  finds that the infringer&#39;s sales are reasonably related to the use of the
  claimant&#39;s design. In such a case, the claimant shall be required to prove
  only the amount of the infringer&#39;s sales and the infringer shall be required
  to prove its expenses against such sales.</blockquote>

  such order shall be certified by the court to the Administrator, who shall
  make an appropriate entry upon the record.</blockquote>

</p><h4>`Sec. 1325. Liability for action on registration
fraudulently obtained</h4>

  the articles may be returned to the country of export whenever it is shown to
  the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the importer had no
  reasonable grounds for believing that his or her acts constituted a violation
