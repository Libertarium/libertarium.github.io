<p class="c1">Macaulay on copyright law</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Eric Flint September 1, 2001</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">These are two speeches given by Thomas Macaulay in
Parliament in 1841, when the issue of copyright was being hammered
out. They are, no other word for it, brilliant  and cover
everything fundamental which is involved in the issue. (For those
not familiar with him, Macaulay would eventually become one of the
foremost British historians of the 19th century. His <i>History of
England</i> remains in print to this day, as do many of his other
writings.)</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">I strongly urge people to read them. Yes, they&#39;re
long  almost 10,000 words  and, yes, Macaulay&#39;s oratorical style
is that of an earlier era. (Although, I&#39;ve got to say, I&#39;m partial
to it. Macaulay orated before the era of &quot;sound bytes.&quot; Thank
God.)</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">But contained herein is all wisdom on the subject, an
immense learning  and plenty of wit. So relax, pour yourself some
coffee (or whatever beverage of your choice) (or whatever,
preferably not hallucinogenic), and take the time to read it. The
&quot;oh-so-modern&quot; subject of &quot;electronic piracy&quot; contains no problems
which Macaulay didn&#39;t already address, at least in essence, more
than a century and a half ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">I should note that Macaulay&#39;s position, slightly
modified, <i>did</i> become the basis of copyright law in the
English speaking world. And remained so (at least in the US) for a
century and a half  until, on a day of infamy just a few years
ago, the Walt Disney Corporation and their stooges in Congress got
the law changed to the modern law, which extends copyright for a
truly absurd period of time. Which  those who forget history are
doomed to repeat it  is a return to the position advocated by
Macaulay&#39;s (now long forgotten) opponent in the debate.</p>

<p class="c5">A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 5TH
OF FEBRUARY 1841</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">by Thomas Babington Macaulay</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c6">On the twenty-ninth of January 1841, Mr Serjeant
Talfourd obtained leave to bring in a bill to amend the law of
copyright. The object of this bill was to extend the term of
copyright in a book to sixty years, reckoned from the death of the
writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c6">On the fifth of February Mr Serjeant Talfourd moved
that the bill should be read a second time. In reply to him the
following Speech was made. The bill was rejected by 45 votes to
38.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Though, Sir, it is in some sense agreeable to
approach a subject with which political animosities have nothing to
do, I offer myself to your notice with some reluctance. It is
painful to me to take a course which may possibly be misunderstood
or misrepresented as unfriendly to the interests of literature and
literary men. It is painful to me, I will add, to oppose my
honourable and learned friend on a question which he has taken up
from the purest motives, and which he regards with a parental
interest. These feelings have hitherto kept me silent when the law
of copyright has been under discussion. But as I am, on full
consideration, satisfied that the measure before us will, if
adopted, inflict grievous injury on the public, without conferring
any compensating advantage on men of letters, I think it my duty to
avow that opinion and to defend it.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">The first thing to be done, Sir, is to settle on what
principles the question is to be argued. Are we free to legislate
for the public good, or are we not? Is this a question of
expediency, or is it a question of right? Many of those who have
written and petitioned against the existing state of things treat
the question as one of right. The law of nature, according to them,
gives to every man a sacred and indefeasible property in his own
ideas, in the fruits of his own reason and imagination. The
legislature has indeed the power to take away this property, just
as it has the power to pass an act of attainder for cutting off an
innocent man&#39;s head without a trial. But, as such an act of
attainder would be legal murder, so would an act invading the right
of an author to his copy be, according to these gentlemen, legal
robbery.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Now, Sir, if this be so, let justice be done, cost
what it may. I am not prepared, like my honourable and learned
friend, to agree to a compromise between right and expediency, and
to commit an injustice for the public convenience. But I must say,
that his theory soars far beyond the reach of my faculties. It is
not necessary to go, on the present occasion, into a metaphysical
inquiry about the origin of the right of property; and certainly
nothing but the strongest necessity would lead me to discuss a
subject so likely to be distasteful to the House. I agree, I own,
with Paley in thinking that property is the creature of the law,
and that the law which creates property can be defended only on
this ground, that it is a law beneficial to mankind. But it is
unnecessary to debate that point. For, even if I believed in a
natural right of property, independent of utility and anterior to
legislation, I should still deny that this right could survive the
original proprietor. Few, I apprehend, even of those who have
studied in the most mystical and sentimental schools of moral
philosophy, will be disposed to maintain that there is a natural
law of succession older and of higher authority than any human
code. If there be, it is quite certain that we have abuses to
reform much more serious than any connected with the question of
copyright. For this natural law can be only one; and the modes of
succession in the Queen&#39;s dominions are twenty. To go no further
than England, land generally descends to the eldest son. In Kent
the sons share and share alike. In many districts the youngest
takes the whole. Formerly a portion of a man&#39;s personal property
was secured to his family; and it was only of the residue that he
could dispose by will. Now he can dispose of the whole by will: but
you limited his power, a few years ago, by enacting that the will
should not be valid unless there were two witnesses. If a man dies
intestate, his personal property generally goes according to the
statute of distributions; but there are local customs which modify
that statute. Now which of all these systems is conformed to the
eternal standard of right? Is it primogeniture, or gavelkind, or
borough English? Are wills jure divino? Are the two witnesses jure
divino? Might not the pars rationabilis of our old law have a fair
claim to be regarded as of celestial institution? Was the statute
of distributions enacted in Heaven long before it was adopted by
Parliament? Or is it to Custom of York, or to Custom of London,
that this pre- eminence belongs? Surely, Sir, even those who hold
that there is a natural right of property must admit that rules
prescribing the manner in which the effects of deceased persons
shall be distributed are purely arbitrary, and originate altogether
in the will of the legislature. If so, Sir, there is no controversy
between my honourable and learned friend and myself as to the
principles on which this question is to be argued. For the existing
law gives an author copyright during his natural life; nor do I
propose to invade that privilege, which I should, on the contrary,
be prepared to defend strenuously against any assailant. The only
point in issue between us is, how long after an author&#39;s death the
State shall recognise a copyright in his representatives and
assigns; and it can, I think, hardly be disputed by any rational
man that this is a point which the legislature is free to determine
in the way which may appear to be most conducive to the general
good.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">We may now, therefore, I think, descend from these
high regions, where we are in danger of being lost in the clouds,
to firm ground and clear light. Let us look at this question like
legislators, and after fairly balancing conveniences and
inconveniences, pronounce between the existing law of copyright,
and the law now proposed to us. The question of copyright, Sir,
like most questions of civil prudence, is neither black nor white,
but grey. The system of copyright has great advantages and great
disadvantages; and it is our business to ascertain what these are,
and then to make an arrangement under which the advantages may be
as far as possible secured, and the disadvantages as far as
possible excluded. The charge which I bring against my honourable
and learned friend&#39;s bill is this, that it leaves the advantages
nearly what they are at present, and increases the disadvantages at
least fourfold.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">The advantages arising from a system of copyright are
obvious. It is desirable that we should have a supply of good
books; we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are
liberally remunerated; and the least objectionable way of
remunerating them is by means of copyright. You cannot depend for
literary instruction and amusement on the leisure of men occupied
in the pursuits of active life. Such men may occasionally produce
compositions of great merit. But you must not look to such men for
works which require deep meditation and long research. Works of
that kind you can expect only from persons who make literature the
business of their lives. Of these persons few will be found among
the rich and the noble. The rich and the noble are not impelled to
intellectual exertion by necessity. They may be impelled to
intellectual exertion by the desire of distinguishing themselves,
or by the desire of benefiting the community. But it is generally
within these walls that they seek to signalise themselves and to
serve their fellow-creatures. Both their ambition and their public
spirit, in a country like this, naturally take a political turn. It
is then on men whose profession is literature, and whose private
means are not ample, that you must rely for a supply of valuable
books. Such men must be remunerated for their literary labour. And
there are only two ways in which they can be remunerated. One of
those ways is patronage; the other is copyright.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">There have been times in which men of letters looked,
not to the public, but to the government, or to a few great men,
for the reward of their exertions. It was thus in the time of
Maecenas and Pollio at Rome, of the Medici at Florence, of Louis
the Fourteenth in France, of Lord Halifax and Lord Oxford in this
country. Now, Sir, I well know that there are cases in which it is
fit and graceful, nay, in which it is a sacred duty to reward the
merits or to relieve the distresses of men of genius by the
exercise of this species of liberality. But these cases are
exceptions. I can conceive no system more fatal to the integrity
and independence of literary men than one under which they should
be taught to look for their daily bread to the favour of ministers
and nobles. I can conceive no system more certain to turn those
minds which are formed by nature to be the blessings and ornaments
of our species into public scandals and pests.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">We have, then, only one resource left. We must betake
ourselves to copyright, be the inconveniences of copyright what
they may. Those inconveniences, in truth, are neither few nor
small. Copyright is monopoly, and produces all the effects which
the general voice of mankind attributes to monopoly. My honourable
and learned friend talks very contemptuously of those who are led
away by the theory that monopoly makes things dear. That monopoly
makes things dear is certainly a theory, as all the great truths
which have been established by the experience of all ages and
nations, and which are taken for granted in all reasonings, may be
said to be theories. It is a theory in the same sense in which it
is a theory that day and night follow each other, that lead is
heavier than water, that bread nourishes, that arsenic poisons,
that alcohol intoxicates. If, as my honourable and learned friend
seems to think, the whole world is in the wrong on this point, if
the real effect of monopoly is to make articles good and cheap, why
does he stop short in his career of change? Why does he limit the
operation of so salutary a principle to sixty years? Why does he
consent to anything short of a perpetuity? He told us that in
consenting to anything short of a perpetuity he was making a
compromise between extreme right and expediency. But if his opinion
about monopoly be correct, extreme right and expediency would
coincide. Or rather, why should we not restore the monopoly of the
East India trade to the East India Company? Why should we not
revive all those old monopolies which, in Elizabeth&#39;s reign, galled
our fathers so severely that, maddened by intolerable wrong, they
opposed to their sovereign a resistance before which her haughty
spirit quailed for the first and for the last time? Was it the
cheapness and excellence of commodities that then so violently
stirred the indignation of the English people? I believe, Sir, that
I may with safety take it for granted that the effect of monopoly
generally is to make articles scarce, to make them dear, and to
make them bad. And I may with equal safety challenge my honourable
friend to find out any distinction between copyright and other
privileges of the same kind; any reason why a monopoly of books
should produce an effect directly the reverse of that which was
produced by the East India Company&#39;s monopoly of tea, or by Lord
Essex&#39;s monopoly of sweet wines. Thus, then, stands the case. It is
good that authors should be remunerated; and the least
exceptionable way of remunerating them is by a monopoly. Yet
monopoly is an evil. For the sake of the good we must submit to the
evil; but the evil ought not to last a day longer than is necessary
for the purpose of securing the good.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Now, I will not affirm that the existing law is
perfect, that it exactly hits the point at which the monopoly ought
to cease; but this I confidently say, that the existing law is very
much nearer that point than the law proposed by my honourable and
learned friend. For consider this; the evil effects of the monopoly
are proportioned to the length of its duration. But the good
effects for the sake of which we bear with the evil effects are by
no means proportioned to the length of its duration. A monopoly of
sixty years produces twice as much evil as a monopoly of thirty
years, and thrice as much evil as a monopoly of twenty years. But
it is by no means the fact that a posthumous monopoly of sixty
years gives to an author thrice as much pleasure and thrice as
strong a motive as a posthumous monopoly of twenty years. On the
contrary, the difference is so small as to be hardly perceptible.
We all know how faintly we are affected by the prospect of very
distant advantages, even when they are advantages which we may
reasonably hope that we shall ourselves enjoy. But an advantage
that is to be enjoyed more than half a century after we are dead,
by somebody, we know not by whom, perhaps by somebody unborn, by
somebody utterly unconnected with us, is really no motive at all to
action. It is very probable that in the course of some generations
land in the unexplored and unmapped heart of the Australasian
continent will be very valuable. But there is none of us who would
lay down five pounds for a whole province in the heart of the
Australasian continent. We know, that neither we, nor anybody for
whom we care, will ever receive a farthing of rent from such a
province. And a man is very little moved by the thought that in the
year 2000 or 2100, somebody who claims through him will employ more
shepherds than Prince Esterhazy, and will have the finest house and
gallery of pictures at Victoria or Sydney. Now, this is the sort of
boon which my honourable and learned friend holds out to authors.
Considered as a boon to them, it is a mere nullity, but considered
as an impost on the public, it is no nullity, but a very serious
and pernicious reality. I will take an example. Dr Johnson died
fifty-six years ago. If the law were what my honourable and learned
friend wishes to make it, somebody would now have the monopoly of
Dr Johnson&#39;s works. Who that somebody would be it is impossible to
say; but we may venture to guess. I guess, then, that it would have
been some bookseller, who was the assign of another bookseller, who
was the grandson of a third bookseller, who had bought the
copyright from Black Frank, the doctor&#39;s servant and residuary
legatee, in 1785 or 1786. Now, would the knowledge that this
copyright would exist in 1841 have been a source of gratification
to Johnson? Would it have stimulated his exertions? Would it have
once drawn him out of his bed before noon? Would it have once
cheered him under a fit of the spleen? Would it have induced him to
give us one more allegory, one more life of a poet, one more
imitation of Juvenal? I firmly believe not. I firmly believe that a
hundred years ago, when he was writing our debates for the
Gentleman&#39;s Magazine, he would very much rather have had twopence
to buy a plate of shin of beef at a cook&#39;s shop underground.
Considered as a reward to him, the difference between a twenty
years&#39; and sixty years&#39; term of posthumous copyright would have
been nothing or next to nothing. But is the difference nothing to
us? I can buy Rasselas for sixpence; I might have had to give five
shillings for it. I can buy the Dictionary, the entire genuine
Dictionary, for two guineas, perhaps for less; I might have had to
give five or six guineas for it. Do I grudge this to a man like Dr
Johnson? Not at all. Show me that the prospect of this boon roused
him to any vigorous effort, or sustained his spirits under
depressing circumstances, and I am quite willing to pay the price
of such an object, heavy as that price is. But what I do complain
of is that my circumstances are to be worse, and Johnson&#39;s none the
better; that I am to give five pounds for what to him was not worth
a farthing.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">The principle of copyright is this. It is a tax on
readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers. The tax is
an exceedingly bad one; it is a tax on one of the most innocent and
most salutary of human pleasures; and never let us forget, that a
tax on innocent pleasures is a premium on vicious pleasures. I
admit, however, the necessity of giving a bounty to genius and
learning. In order to give such a bounty, I willingly submit even
to this severe and burdensome tax. Nay, I am ready to increase the
tax, if it can be shown that by so doing I should proportionally
increase the bounty. My complaint is, that my honourable and
learned friend doubles, triples, quadruples, the tax, and makes
scarcely any perceptible addition to the bounty. Why, Sir, what is
the additional amount of taxation which would have been levied on
the public for Dr Johnson&#39;s works alone, if my honourable and
learned friend&#39;s bill had been the law of the land? I have not data
sufficient to form an opinion. But I am confident that the taxation
on his Dictionary alone would have amounted to many thousands of
pounds. In reckoning the whole additional sum which the holders of
his copyrights would have taken out of the pockets of the public
during the last half century at twenty thousand pounds, I feel
satisfied that I very greatly underrate it. Now, I again say that I
think it but fair that we should pay twenty thousand pounds in
consideration of twenty thousand pounds&#39; worth of pleasure and
encouragement received by Dr Johnson. But I think it very hard that
we should pay twenty thousand pounds for what he would not have
valued at five shillings.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">My honourable and learned friend dwells on the claims
of the posterity of great writers. Undoubtedly, Sir, it would be
very pleasing to see a descendant of Shakespeare living in opulence
on the fruits of his great ancestor&#39;s genius. A house maintained in
splendour by such a patrimony would be a more interesting and
striking object than Blenheim is to us, or than Strathfieldsaye
will be to our children. But, unhappily, it is scarcely possible
that, under any system, such a thing can come to pass. My
honourable and learned friend does not propose that copyright shall
descend to the eldest son, or shall be bound up by irrecoverable
entail. It is to be merely personal property. It is therefore
highly improbable that it will descend during sixty years or half
that term from parent to child. The chance is that more people than
one will have an interest in it. They will in all probability sell
it and divide the proceeds. The price which a bookseller will give
for it will bear no proportion to the sum which he will afterwards
draw from the public, if his speculation proves successful. He will
give little, if anything, more for a term of sixty years than for a
term of thirty or five and twenty. The present value of a distant
advantage is always small; but when there is great room to doubt
whether a distant advantage will be any advantage at all, the
present value sink to almost nothing. Such is the inconstancy of
the public taste that no sensible man will venture to pronounce,
with confidence, what the sale of any book published in our days
will be in the years between 1890 and 1900. The whole fashion of
thinking and writing has often undergone a change in a much shorter
period than that to which my honourable and learned friend would
extend posthumous copyright. What would have been considered the
best literary property in the earlier part of Charles the Second&#39;s
reign? I imagine Cowley&#39;s Poems. Overleap sixty years, and you are
in the generation of which Pope asked, &quot;Who now reads Cowley?&quot; What
works were ever expected with more impatience by the public than
those of Lord Bolingbroke, which appeared, I think, in 1754? In
1814, no bookseller would have thanked you for the copyright of
them all, if you had offered it to him for nothing. What would
Paternoster Row give now for the copyright of Hayley&#39;s Triumphs of
Temper, so much admired within the memory of many people still
living? I say, therefore, that, from the very nature of literary
property, it will almost always pass away from an author&#39;s family;
and I say, that the price given for it to the family will bear a
very small proportion to the tax which the purchaser, if his
speculation turns out well, will in the course of a long series of
years levy on the public.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">If, Sir, I wished to find a strong and perfect
illustration of the effects which I anticipate from long copyright,
I should select,my honourable and learned friend will be
surprised,I should select the case of Milton&#39;s granddaughter. As
often as this bill has been under discussion, the fate of Milton&#39;s
granddaughter has been brought forward by the advocates of
monopoly. My honourable and learned friend has repeatedly told the
story with great eloquence and effect. He has dilated on the
sufferings, on the abject poverty, of this ill-fated woman, the
last of an illustrious race. He tells us that, in the extremity of
her distress, Garrick gave her a benefit, that Johnson wrote a
prologue, and that the public contributed some hundreds of pounds.
Was it fit, he asks, that she should receive, in this eleemosynary
form, a small portion of what was in truth a debt? Why, he asks,
instead of obtaining a pittance from charity, did she not live in
comfort and luxury on the proceeds of the sale of her ancestor&#39;s
works? But, Sir, will my honourable and learned friend tell me that
this event, which he has so often and so pathetically described,
was caused by the shortness of the term of copyright? Why, at that
time, the duration of copyright was longer than even he, at
present, proposes to make it. The monopoly lasted, not sixty years,
but for ever. At the time at which Milton&#39;s granddaughter asked
charity, Milton&#39;s works were the exclusive property of a
bookseller. Within a few months of the day on which the benefit was
given at Garrick&#39;s theatre, the holder of the copyright of Paradise
Lost,I think it was Tonson,applied to the Court of Chancery for
an injunction against a bookseller who had published a cheap
edition of the great epic poem, and obtained the injunction. The
representation of Comus was, if I remember rightly, in 1750; the
injunction in 1752. Here, then, is a perfect illustration of the
effect of long copyright. Milton&#39;s works are the property of a
single publisher. Everybody who wants them must buy them at
Tonson&#39;s shop, and at Tonson&#39;s price. Whoever attempts to undersell
Tonson is harassed with legal proceedings. Thousands who would
gladly possess a copy of Paradise Lost, must forego that great
enjoyment. And what, in the meantime, is the situation of the only
person for whom we can suppose that the author, protected at such a
cost to the public, was at all interested? She is reduced to utter
destitution. Milton&#39;s works are under a monopoly. Milton&#39;s
granddaughter is starving. The reader is pillaged; but the writer&#39;s
family is not enriched. Society is taxed doubly. It has to give an
exorbitant price for the poems; and it has at the same time to give
alms to the only surviving descendant of the poet.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">But this is not all. I think it right, Sir, to call
the attention of the House to an evil, which is perhaps more to be
apprehended when an author&#39;s copyright remains in the hands of his
family, than when it is transferred to booksellers. I seriously
fear that, if such a measure as this should be adopted, many
valuable works will be either totally suppressed or grievously
mutilated. I can prove that this danger is not chimerical; and I am
quite certain that, if the danger be real, the safeguards which my
honourable and learned friend has devised are altogether nugatory.
That the danger is not chimerical may easily be shown. Most of us,
I am sure, have known persons who, very erroneously as I think, but
from the best motives, would not choose to reprint Fielding&#39;s
novels, or Gibbon&#39;s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire. Some gentlemen may perhaps be of opinion that it would be
as well if Tom Jones and Gibbon&#39;s History were never reprinted. I
will not, then, dwell on these or similar cases. I will take cases
respecting which it is not likely that there will be any difference
of opinion here; cases, too, in which the danger of which I now
speak is not matter of supposition, but matter of fact. Take
Richardson&#39;s novels. Whatever I may, on the present occasion, think
of my honourable and learned friend&#39;s judgment as a legislator, I
must always respect his judgment as a critic. He will, I am sure,
say that Richardson&#39;s novels are among the most valuable, among the
most original works in our language. No writings have done more to
raise the fame of English genius in foreign countries. No writings
are more deeply pathetic. No writings, those of Shakspeare
excepted, show more profound knowledge of the human heart. As to
their moral tendency, I can cite the most respectable testimony. Dr
Johnson describes Richardson as one who had taught the passions to
move at the command of virtue. My dear and honoured friend, Mr
Wilberforce, in his celebrated religious treatise, when speaking of
the unchristian tendency of the fashionable novels of the
eighteenth century, distinctly excepts Richardson from the censure.
Another excellent person, whom I can never mention without respect
and kindness, Mrs Hannah More, often declared in conversation, and
has declared in one of her published poems, that she first learned
from the writings of Richardson those principles of piety by which
her life was guided. I may safely say that books celebrated as
works of art through the whole civilised world, and praised for
their moral tendency by Dr Johnson, by Mr Wilberforce, by Mrs
Hannah More, ought not to be suppressed. Sir, it is my firm belief,
that if the law had been what my honourable and learned friend
proposes to make it, they would have been suppressed. I remember
Richardson&#39;s grandson well; he was a clergyman in the city of
London; he was a most upright and excellent man; but he had
conceived a strong prejudice against works of fiction. He thought
all novel-reading not only frivolous but sinful. He said,this I
state on the authority of one of his clerical brethren who is now a
bishop,he said that he had never thought it right to read one of
his grandfather&#39;s books. Suppose, Sir, that the law had been what
my honourable and learned friend would make it. Suppose that the
copyright of Richardson&#39;s novels had descended, as might well have
been the case, to this gentleman. I firmly believe, that he would
have thought it sinful to give them a wide circulation. I firmly
believe, that he would not for a hundred thousand pounds have
deliberately done what he thought sinful. He would not have
reprinted them. And what protection does my honourable and learned
friend give to the public in such a case? Why, Sir, what he
proposes is this: if a book is not reprinted during five years, any
person who wishes to reprint it may give notice in the London
Gazette: the advertisement must be repeated three times: a year
must elapse; and then, if the proprietor of the copyright does not
put forth a new edition, he loses his exclusive privilege. Now,
what protection is this to the public? What is a new edition? Does
the law define the number of copies that make an edition? Does it
limit the price of a copy? Are twelve copies on large paper,
charged at thirty guineas each, an edition? It has been usual, when
monopolies have been granted, to prescribe numbers and to limit
prices. But I did not find the my honourable and learned friend
proposes to do so in the present case. And, without some such
provision, the security which he offers is manifestly illusory. It
is my conviction that, under such a system as that which he
recommends to us, a copy of Clarissa would have been as rare as an
Aldus or a Caxton.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">I will give another instance. One of the most
instructive, interesting, and delightful books in our language is
Boswell&#39;s Life of Johnson. Now it is well known that Boswell&#39;s
eldest son considered this book, considered the whole relation of
Boswell to Johnson, as a blot in the escutcheon of the family. He
thought, not perhaps altogether without reason, that his father had
exhibited himself in a ludicrous and degrading light. And thus he
became so sore and irritable that at last he could not bear to hear
the Life of Johnson mentioned. Suppose that the law had been what
my honourable and learned friend wishes to make it. Suppose that
the copyright of Boswell&#39;s Life of Johnson had belonged, as it well
might, during sixty years, to Boswell&#39;s eldest son. What would have
been the consequence? An unadulterated copy of the finest
biographical work in the world would have been as scarce as the
first edition of Camden&#39;s Britannia.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">These are strong cases. I have shown you that, if the
law had been what you are now going to make it, the finest prose
work of fiction in the language, the finest biographical work in
the language, would very probably have been suppressed. But I have
stated my case weakly. The books which I have mentioned are
singularly inoffensive books, books not touching on any of those
questions which drive even wise men beyond the bounds of wisdom.
There are books of a very different kind, books which are the
rallying points of great political and religious parties. What is
likely to happen if the copyright of one of the these books should
by descent or transfer come into the possession of some hostile
zealot? I will take a single instance. It is only fifty years since
John Wesley died; and all his works, if the law had been what my
honourable and learned friend wishes to make it, would now have
been the property of some person or other. The sect founded by
Wesley is the most numerous, the wealthiest, the most powerful, the
most zealous of sects. In every parliamentary election it is a
matter of the greatest importance to obtain the support of the
Wesleyan Methodists. Their numerical strength is reckoned by
hundreds of thousands. They hold the memory of their founder in the
greatest reverence; and not without reason, for he was
unquestionably a great and a good man. To his authority they
constantly appeal. His works are in their eyes of the highest
value. His doctrinal writings they regard as containing the best
system of theology ever deduced from Scripture. His journals,
interesting even to the common reader, are peculiarly interesting
to the Methodist: for they contain the whole history of that
singular polity which, weak and despised in its beginning, is now,
after the lapse of a century, so strong, so flourishing, and so
formidable. The hymns to which he gave his imprimatur are a most
important part of the public worship of his followers. Now, suppose
that the copyright of these works should belong to some person who
holds the memory of Wesley and the doctrines and discipline of the
Methodists in abhorrence. There are many such persons. The
Ecclesiastical Courts are at this very time sitting on the case of
a clergyman of the Established Church who refused Christian burial
to a child baptized by a Methodist preacher. I took up the other
day a work which is considered as among the most respectable organs
of a large and growing party in the Church of England, and there I
saw John Wesley designated as a forsworn priest. Suppose that the
works of Wesley were suppressed. Why, Sir, such a grievance would
be enough to shake the foundations of Government. Let gentlemen who
are attached to the Church reflect for a moment what their feelings
would be if the Book of Common Prayer were not to be reprinted for
thirty or forty years, if the price of a Book of Common Prayer were
run up to five or ten guineas. And then let them determine whether
they will pass a law under which it is possible, under which it is
probable, that so intolerable a wrong may be done to some sect
consisting perhaps of half a million of persons.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">I am so sensible, Sir, of the kindness with which the
House has listened to me, that I will not detain you longer. I will
only say this, that if the measure before us should pass, and
should produce one-tenth part of the evil which it is calculated to
produce, and which I fully expect it to produce, there will soon be
a remedy, though of a very objectionable kind. Just as the absurd
acts which prohibited the sale of game were virtually repealed by
the poacher, just as many absurd revenue acts have been virtually
repealed by the smuggler, so will this law be virtually repealed by
piratical booksellers. At present the holder of copyright has the
public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are regarded
as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving men.
Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and
compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good
repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions.
Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different
from the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe
this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be
constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be
employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in
the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when
the question is whether some book as popular as Robinson Crusoe, or
the Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, shall be in every cottage, or whether it
shall be confined to the libraries of the rich for the advantage of
the great-grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before,
drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in
great distress? Remember too that, when once it ceases to be
considered as wrong and discreditable to invade literary property,
no person can say where the invasion will stop. The public seldom
makes nice distinctions. The wholesome copyright which now exists
will share in the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which
you are about to create. And you will find that, in attempting to
impose unreasonable restraints on the reprinting of the works of
the dead, you have, to a great extent, annulled those restraints
which now prevent men from pillaging and defrauding the living. If
I saw, Sir, any probability that this bill could be so amended in
the Committee that my objections might be removed, I would not
divide the House in this stage. But I am so fully convinced that no
alteration which would not seem insupportable to my honourable and
learned friend, could render his measure supportable to me, that I
must move, though with regret, that this bill be read a second time
this day six months.</p>

<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c5">A SPEECH DELIVERED IN A COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF
COMMONS ON THE 6TH OF APRIL 1842.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">by Thomas Babington Macaulay</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c6">On the third of March 1842, Lord Mahon obtained
permission to bring in a bill to amend the Law of Copyright. This
bill extended the term of Copyright in a book to twenty-five years,
reckoned from the death of the author.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c6">On the sixth of April the House went into Committee
on the bill, and Mr Greene took the Chair. Several divisions took
place, of which the result was that the plan suggested in the
following Speech was, with some modifications, adopted.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Mr Greene,I have been amused and gratified by the
remarks which my noble friend (Lord Mahon.) has made on the
arguments by which I prevailed on the last House of Commons to
reject the bill introduced by a very able and accomplished man, Mr
Serjeant Talfourd. My noble friend has done me a high and rare
honour. For this is, I believe, the first occasion on which a
speech made in one Parliament has been answered in another. I
should not find it difficult to vindicate the soundness of the
reasons which I formerly urged, to set them in a clearer light, and
to fortify them by additional facts. But it seems to me that we had
better discuss the bill which is now on our table than the bill
which was there fourteen months ago. Glad I am to find that there
is a very wide difference between the two bills, and that my noble
friend, though he has tried to refute my arguments, has acted as if
he had been convinced by them. I objected to the term of sixty
years as far too long. My noble friend has cut that term down to
twenty-five years. I warned the House that, under the provisions of
Mr Serjeant Talfourd&#39;s bill, valuable works might not improbably be
suppressed by the representatives of authors. My noble friend has
prepared a clause which, as he thinks, will guard against that
danger. I will not, therefore, waste the time of the Committee by
debating points which he has conceded, but will proceed at once to
the proper business of this evening.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Sir, I have no objection to the principle of my noble
friend&#39;s bill. Indeed, I had no objection to the principle of the
bill of last year. I have long thought that the term of copyright
ought to be extended. When Mr Serjeant Talfourd moved for leave to
bring in his bill, I did not oppose the motion. Indeed I meant to
vote for the second reading, and to reserve what I had to say for
the Committee. But the learned Serjeant left me no choice. He, in
strong language, begged that nobody who was disposed to reduce the
term of sixty years would divide with him. &quot;Do not,&quot; he said, &quot;give
me your support, if all that you mean to grant to men of letters is
a miserable addition of fourteen or fifteen years to the present
term. I do not wish for such support. I despise it.&quot; Not wishing to
obtrude on the learned Serjeant a support which he despised, I had
no course left but to take the sense of the House on the second
reading. The circumstances are now different. My noble friend&#39;s
bill is not at present a good bill; but it may be improved into a
very good bill; nor will he, I am persuaded, withdraw it if it
should be so improved. He and I have the same object in view; but
we differ as to the best mode of attaining that object. We are
equally desirous to extend the protection now enjoyed by writers.
In what way it may be extended with most benefit to them and with
least inconvenience to the public, is the question.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">The present state of the law is this. The author of a
work has a certain copyright in that work for a term of
twenty-eight years. If he should live more than twenty-eight years
after the publication of the work, he retains the copyright to the
end of his life.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">My noble friend does not propose to make any addition
to the term of twenty-eight years. But he proposes that the
copyright shall last twenty-five years after the author&#39;s death.
Thus my noble friend makes no addition to that term which is
certain, but makes a very large addition to that term which is
uncertain.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">My plan is different. I would made no addition to the
uncertain term; but I would make a large addition to the certain
term. I propose to add fourteen years to the twenty-eight years
which the law now allows to an author. His copyright will, in this
way, last till his death, or till the expiration of forty-two
years, whichever shall first happen. And I think that I shall be
able to prove to the satisfaction of the Committee that my plan
will be more beneficial to literature and to literary men than the
plan of my noble friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">It must surely, Sir, be admitted that the protection
which we give to books ought to be distributed as evenly as
possible, that every book should have a fair share of that
protection, and no book more than a fair share. It would evidently
be absurd to put tickets into a wheel, with different numbers
marked upon them, and to make writers draw, one a term of
twenty-eight years, another a term of fifty, another a term of
ninety. And yet this sort of lottery is what my noble friend
proposes to establish. I know that we cannot altogether exclude
chance. You have two terms of copyright; one certain, the other
uncertain; and we cannot, I admit, get rid of the uncertain term.
It is proper, no doubt, that an author&#39;s copyright should last
during his life. But, Sir, though we cannot altogether exclude
chance, we can very much diminish the share which chance must have
in distributing the recompense which we wish to give to genius and
learning. By every addition which we make to the certain term we
diminish the influence of chance; by every addition which we make
to the uncertain term we increase the influence of chance. I shall
make myself best understood by putting cases. Take two eminent
female writers, who died within our own memory, Madame D&#39;Arblay and
Miss Austen. As the law now stands, Miss Austen&#39;s charming novels
would have only from twenty-eight to thirty-three years of
copyright. For that extraordinary woman died young: she died before
her genius was fully appreciated by the world. Madame D&#39;Arblay
outlived the whole generation to which she belonged. The copyright
of her celebrated novel, Evelina, lasted, under the present law,
sixty-two years. Surely this inequality is sufficiently
greatsixty-two years of copyright for Evelina, only twenty-eight
for Persuasion. But to my noble friend this inequality seems not
great enough. He proposes to add twenty- five years to Madame
D&#39;Arblay&#39;s term, and not a single day to Miss Austen&#39;s term. He
would give to Persuasion a copyright of only twenty-eight years, as
at present, and to Evelina a copyright more than three times as
long, a copyright of eighty- seven years. Now, is this reasonable?
See, on the other hand, the operation of my plan. I make no
addition at all to Madame D&#39;Arblay&#39;s term of sixty-two years, which
is, in my opinion, quite long enough; but I extend Miss Austen&#39;s
term to forty-two years, which is, in my opinion, not too much. You
see, Sir, that at present chance has too much sway in this matter:
that at present the protection which the State gives to letters is
very unequally given. You see that if my noble friend&#39;s plan be
adopted, more will be left to chance than under the present system,
and you will have such inequalities as are unknown under the
present system. You see also that, under the system which I
recommend, we shall have, not perfect certainty, not perfect
equality, but much less uncertainty and inequality than at
present.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">But this is not all. My noble friend&#39;s plan is not
merely to institute a lottery in which some writers will draw
prizes and some will draw blanks. It is much worse than this. His
lottery is so contrived that, in the vast majority of cases, the
blanks will fall to the best books, and the prizes to books of
inferior merit.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Take Shakspeare. My noble friend gives a longer
protection than I should give to Love&#39;s Labour&#39;s Lost, and
Pericles, Prince of Tyre; but he gives a shorter protection than I
should give to Othello and Macbeth.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Take Milton. Milton died in 1674. The copyrights of
Milton&#39;s great works would, according to my noble friend&#39;s plan,
expire in 1699. Comus appeared in 1634, the Paradise Lost in 1668.
To Comus, then, my noble friend would give sixty-five years of
copyright, and to the Paradise Lost only thirty-one years. Is that
reasonable? Comus is a noble poem: but who would rank it with the
Paradise Lost? My plan would give forty-two years both to the
Paradise Lost and to Comus.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Let us pass on from Milton to Dryden. My noble friend
would give more than sixty years of copyright to Dryden&#39;s worst
works; to the encomiastic verses on Oliver Cromwell, to the Wild
Gallant, to the Rival Ladies, to other wretched pieces as bad as
anything written by Flecknoe or Settle: but for Theodore and
Honoria, for Tancred and Sigismunda, for Cimon and Iphigenia, for
Palamon and Arcite, for Alexander&#39;s Feast, my noble friend thinks a
copyright of twenty-eight years sufficient. Of all Pope&#39;s works,
that to which my noble friend would give the largest measure of
protection is the volume of Pastorals, remarkable only as the
production of a boy. Johnson&#39;s first work was a Translation of a
Book of Travels in Abyssinia, published in 1735. It was so poorly
executed that in his later years he did not like to hear it
mentioned. Boswell once picked up a copy of it, and told his friend
that he had done so. &quot;Do not talk about it,&quot; said Johnson: &quot;it is a
thing to be forgotten.&quot; To this performance my noble friend would
give protection during the enormous term of seventy-five years. To
the Lives of the Poets he would give protection during about thirty
years. Well; take Henry Fielding; it matters not whom I take, but
take Fielding. His early works are read only by the curious, and
would not be read even by the curious, but for the fame which he
acquired in the latter part of his life by works of a very
different kind. What is the value of the Temple Beau, of the
Intriguing Chambermaid, of half a dozen other plays of which few
gentlemen have even heard the names? Yet to these worthless pieces
my noble friend would give a term of copyright longer by more than
twenty years than that which he would give to Tom Jones and
Amelia.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">Go on to Burke. His little tract, entitled the
Vindication of Natural Society is certainly not without merit; but
it would not be remembered in our days if it did not bear the name
of Burke. To this tract my noble friend would give a copyright of
near seventy years. But to the great work on the French Revolution,
to the Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs, to the letters on the
Regicide Peace, he would give a copyright of thirty years or little
more.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">And, Sir observe that I am not selecting here and
there extraordinary instances in order to make up the semblance of
a case. I am taking the greatest names of our literature in
chronological order. Go to other nations; go to remote ages; you
will still find the general rule the same. There was no copyright
at Athens or Rome; but the history of the Greek and Latin
literature illustrates my argument quite as well as if copyright
had existed in ancient times. Of all the plays of Sophocles, the
one to which the plan of my noble friend would have given the most
scanty recompense would have been that wonderful masterpiece, the
Oedipus at Colonos. Who would class together the Speech of
Demosthenes against his Guardians, and the Speech for the Crown? My
noble friend, indeed, would not class them together. For to the
Speech against the Guardians he would give a copyright of near
seventy years, and to the incomparable Speech for the Crown a
copyright of less than half that length. Go to Rome. My noble
friend would give more than twice as long a term to Cicero&#39;s
juvenile declamation in defence of Roscius Amerinus as to the
Second Philippic. Go to France. My noble friend would give a far
longer term to Racine&#39;s Freres Ennemis than to Athalie, and to
Moliere&#39;s Etourdi than to Tartuffe. Go to Spain. My noble friend
would give a longer term to forgotten works of Cervantes, works
which nobody now reads, than to Don Quixote. Go to Germany.
According to my noble friend&#39;s plan, of all the works of Schiller
the Robbers would be the most favoured: of all the works of Goethe,
the Sorrows of Werter would be the most favoured. I thank the
Committee for listening so kindly to this long enumeration.
Gentlemen will perceive, I am sure, that it is not from pedantry
that I mention the names of so many books and authors. But just as,
in our debates on civil affairs, we constantly draw illustrations
from civil history, we must, in a debate about literary property,
draw our illustrations from literary history. Now, Sir, I have, I
think, shown from literary history that the effect of my noble
friend&#39;s plan would be to give to crude and imperfect works, to
third-rate and fourth-rate works, a great advantage over the
highest productions of genius. It is impossible to account for the
facts which I have laid before you by attributing them to mere
accident. Their number is too great, their character too uniform.
We must seek for some other explanation; and we shall easily find
one.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">It is the law of our nature that the mind shall
attain its full power by slow degrees; and this is especially true
of the most vigorous minds. Young men, no doubt, have often
produced works of great merit; but it would be impossible to name
any writer of the first order whose juvenile performances were his
best. That all the most valuable books of history, of philology, of
physical and metaphysical science, of divinity, of political
economy, have been produced by men of mature years will hardly be
disputed. The case may not be quite so clear as respects works of
the imagination. And yet I know no work of the imagination of the
very highest class that was ever, in any age or country, produced
by a man under thirty-five. Whatever powers a youth may have
received from nature, it is impossible that his taste and judgment
can be ripe, that his mind can be richly stored with images, that
he can have observed the vicissitudes of life, that he can have
studied the nicer shades of character. How, as Marmontel very
sensibly said, is a person to paint portraits who has never seen
faces? On the whole, I believe that I may, without fear of
contradiction, affirm this, that of the good books now extant in
the world more than nineteen-twentieths were published after the
writers had attained the age of forty. If this be so, it is evident
that the plan of my noble friend is framed on a vicious principle.
For, while he gives to juvenile productions a very much larger
protection than they now enjoy, he does comparatively little for
the works of men in the full maturity of their powers, and
absolutely nothing for any work which is published during the last
three years of the life of the writer. For, by the existing law,
the copyright of such a work lasts twenty-eight years from the
publication; and my noble friend gives only twenty-five years, to
be reckoned from the writer&#39;s death.</p>
</div>
<div class="c4" name="Normal">
<p class="c3">What I recommend is that the certain term, reckoned
from the date of publication, shall be forty-two years instead of
twenty-eight years. In this arrangement there is no uncertainty, no
inequality. The advantage which I propose to give will be the same
to every book. No work will have so long a copyright as my noble
friend gives to some books, or so short a copyright as he gives to
others. No copyright will last ninety years. No copyright will end
in twenty-eight years. To every book published in the course of the
last seventeen years of a writer&#39;s life I give a longer term of
copyright than my noble friend gives; and I am confident that no
person versed in literary history will deny this,that in general
the most valuable works of an author are published in the course of
the last seventeen years of his life. I will rapidly enumerate a
few, and but a few, of the great works of English writers to which
my plan is more favourable than my noble friend&#39;s plan. To Lear, to
Macbeth, to Othello, to the Fairy Queen, to the Paradise Lost, to
Bacon&#39;s Novum Organum and De Augmentis, to Locke&#39;s Essay on the
Human Understanding, to Clarendon&#39;s History, to Hume&#39;s History, to
Gibbon&#39;s History, to Smith&#39;s Wealth of Nations, to Addison&#39;s
Spectators, to almost all the great works of Burke, to Clarissa and
Sir Charles Grandison, to Joseph Andrews, Tom Jones and Amelia,
and, with the single exception of Waverley, to all the novels of
Sir Walter Scott, I give a longer term of copyright than my noble
friend gives. Can he match that list? Does not that list contain
what England has produced greatest in many various wayspoetry,
philosophy, history, eloquence, wit, skilful portraiture of life
and manners? I confidently therefore call on the Committee to take
my plan in preference to the plan of my noble friend. I have shown
that the protection which he proposes to give to letters is
unequal, and unequal in the worst way. I have shown that his plan
is to give protection to books in inverse proportion to their
merit. I shall move when we come to the third clause of the bill to
omit the words &quot;twenty-five years,&quot; and in a subsequent part of the
same clause I shall move to substitute for the words &quot;twenty-eight
years&quot; the words &quot;forty-two years.&quot; I earnestly hope that the
Committee will adopt these amendments; and I feel the firmest
conviction that my noble friend&#39;s bill, so amended, will confer a
great boon on men of letters with the smallest possible
inconvenience to the public.</p>
