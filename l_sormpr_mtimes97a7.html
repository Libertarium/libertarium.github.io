</p><p><strong><big><big>Beware FSB Surveillance Of Internet </big></big></strong>
</p><p>EDITORIAL
</p><p>In a master control room in the bowels of the Lubyanka, teams of FSB<br />
agents spend their days intercepting private correspondences sent via the<br />
Internet between friends, lovers, business partners, politicians. And there<br />
is no one watching the watchers.
</p><p>It&#39;s a disturbing idea. And as Jen Tracy reports in Business Extra on Page<br />
15, it is well on its way to becoming a reality.
</p><p>A new regulation known as SORM-2 is under review at the Justice Ministry,<br />
awaiting minor tweaks before its eventual enactment. This regulation would<br />
allow the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to conduct real-time monitoring<br />
of every e-mail message, credit card transaction and web page sent or<br />
received in Russia.
</p><p>The SORM-2 arrangement would have this information piling up in FSB<br />
computers. In theory, the FSB would need a warrant to look at any of it; in<br />
practice, however, the FSB has already demanded such information from<br />
Internet service providers without warrants, so there is no reason to<br />
expect particular compliance with the constitution on that point.
</p><p>The U.S. government already monitors international e-mail traffic through<br />
the National Security Administration, and the NSA&#39;s legal authority to do<br />
so seems equally dubious. But at least the NSA, unlike the FSB, has never<br />
been accused of selling the information gathered for use as political<br />
kompromat or using it to blackmail prominent businessmen. Nor, for that<br />
matter, does the NSA trace its roots to that of a Soviet secret police<br />
organ that tortured and killed.
</p><p>The SORM-2 proposal also calls for Internet service providers themselves<br />
to lay out the thousands of dollars it will likely cost to install the<br />
surveillance hardware the FSB needs. Providers will pass on the cost of<br />
this hardware to the consumers in the form of a 15 percent cost hike -<br />
which means Internet users will pay more for the pleasure of being spied<br />
upon.
</p><p>That Internet service providers are a bit timid in leading the fight<br />
against SORM-2 is not surprising - the FSB can just pull the licenses of<br />
troublemakers and shut down their businesses. But SORM-2 ought to be<br />
derailed, and providers should be encouraged to do more.
</p><p>For starters, providers could indeed dump old stored e-mails from their<br />
computers. These e-mails are stored as a byproduct of programs that track<br />
each Internet user&#39;s web hits - but those programs could also be rewritten<br />
to be more selective. Providers have no business storing old e-mails for<br />
long periods of time - only so the FSB can come along and demand to read<br />
them.
</p><p>***************************
</p><p><big><big><strong>Who Reads Your E-mail?</strong></big></big>
</p><p>By Jen Tracy
</p><p>Imagine every one of your incoming and outgoing e-mails, every one <br />
of your credit card purchases and every one of your electronic <br />
banking transactions popping up in real time on a computer at the <br />
Lubyanka, the former KGB headquarters that now houses Russia&#39;s <br />
Federal Security Service. Imagine the FSB&#39;s computers collecting and <br />
storing this information - for years, perhaps even decades - without <br />
ever once bothering to obtain a warrant. That is the reality the FSB <br />
is striving toward with a little-known legal project dubbed SORM-2. <br />
The Russian security service is seeking what its American <br />
counterparts have long enjoyed: complete access to the electronic <br />
communications traffic of the nation&#39;s people and organizations.
</p><p>SORM is the Russian acronym for Sistema Operativno-Rozysknykh <br />
Meropriyatii, or System for Operational-Investigative Activities. A <br />
1995 regulation called SORM -1 gave the security services the power <br />
to monitor all telecommunications transmissions - provided they first <br />
obtained a warrant.
</p><p>That is the way things work now: The FSB and FAPSI, the Federal <br />
Agency for Governmental Communication and Information, already <br />
monitor e-mail transmissions. To do so, they must either tap into someone&#39;s <br />
telephone - a time-consuming process that involves physically <br />
splicing into select lines - or visit that someone&#39;s Internet service <br />
provider. Either way, transmissions cannot be monitored in real time, <br />
and the FSB needs a warrant before it can even get started.
</p><p>In August, however, the FSB and the State Communications Agency,<br />
Goskomsvyaz, drew up an addendum to the SORM regulations called <br />
SORM-2. It would require all of Russia&#39;s Internet service providers - <br />
there are about 350 across the nation - to install an FSB-provided <br />
&quot;black box&quot; monitoring device in their main computers, and to build a <br />
high-speed fiber-optic line from that device to the FSB. Because <br />
SORM-2 is to be enacted as a regulation and not a law, it will be <br />
reviewed by the Justice Ministry, but will not need the approval of <br />
either parliament or President Boris Yeltsin.
</p><p>These SORM-2 listening devices would route copies of all Internet <br />
traffic to FSB computers - warrant or no. In theory, a warrant would <br />
be needed to actually read any of the documentation piling up in the <br />
FSB&#39;s hands. But in practice, human rights groups say, the FSB is <br />
unlikely to worry about such legal niceties when the information it <br />
wants is just a mouse-click away. In other words, human rights <br />
activists are predicting a complete loss of Internet privacy for the<br />
more than 1 million people in Russia who use the Internet - and for <br />
tens of thousands more who use credit cards or other electronic <br />
banking instruments here.
</p><p>&quot;This is a police-state practice. (The FSB) should not be alone <br />
in its right to surveillance. Society should be able to audit the <br />
agency in return. It&#39;s a step toward dictatorship,&quot; said Anatoly <br />
Levenchuk, a Moscow-based Internet expert - and the man who first <br />
revealed the existence of SORM-2, by posting a draft of the FSB <br />
project on his own web site, <a href="index.html">www.libertarium.ru</a>.
</p><p>But the FSB is not the first to come up with the idea of tracking <br />
all Internet traffic. The U.S. National Security Agency has been <br />
doing it for years: Electronic surveillance information is collected <br />
from across North America, Europe and Australia through an <br />
international network called ECHELON, and routed to the NSA complex <br />
in Fort Meade, Maryland.
</p><p>The NSA has never confirmed that. But then, the NSA&#39;s own <br />
existence was a secret - despite its staggering annual budget of $ 8 <br />
billion - until a 1982 book, &quot;Puzzle Palace,&quot; told about it. Since <br />
then the NSA has set up its own web page (www.nsa.gov:8080) - and <br />
more and more information has come out in recent years about its <br />
activities.
</p><p>&quot;Within Europe, all e-mail, telephone and fax communications are <br />
routinely intercepted by the United States National Security Agency,&quot; <br />
according to a report commissioned by the European Parliament, and <br />
presented to the parliament in January 1998.
</p><p>&quot;ECHELON indiscriminately intercepts large quantities of <br />
communications and uses computers to identify and extract messages of <br />
interest from the mass of unwanted ones,&quot; wrote New Zealand author <br />
and researcher Nicky Hager in a 1996 book about the NSA, &quot;Secret <br />
Power.&quot; A key difference between the American and Russian security <br />
services is that Russian spetssluzhby have a nasty habit of selling <br />
information gathered electronically to the highest bidder, and the <br />
information ends up serving political ends. As Noviye Izvestia noted <br />
Friday, Internet users are already ironically referring to SORM as <br />
Sistema Oblegcheniya Rassledovaniya Materialov, which could be <br />
roughly translated as a System for Scandalously Unveiling <br />
Investigative Materials. The newspaper Novaya Gazeta in January even <br />
argued that this was the main point of SORM-2 - to let FSB agents <br />
gather material for use in blackmailing business people and for other <br />
dubious yet profitable activities.
</p><p>The FSB can only dream of the $ 8 billion allocated to the NSA: <br />
The entire 1999 Russian federal budget only foresees spending of <br />
about $ 25 billion at current exchange rates.
</p><p>In SORM-2, however, the FSB has come up with its own solution to <br />
the expensive problem of setting up a Russian-style ECHELON system: <br />
The FSB wants Internet service providers to pay for the installation <br />
and maintenance of the SORM-2 black boxes and dedicated FSB hotlines.
</p><p>Providers and Internet analysts say picking up the costs of <br />
SORM-2 would set providers back thousands of dollars a month. That <br />
extra cost would be passed on to Internet users in the form of <br />
markups of 10 percent to 15 percent - which could be horrible for <br />
business, as Internet access in Russia is already expensive, running <br />
at least $ 30 or $ 40 a month for most people.
</p><p>Dozens of the nation&#39;s smaller providers would not be able to <br />
sustain the burden of paying for both their own costs and for SORM-2.
</p><p>&quot;The SORM-2 financial burden will be quite heavy for small <br />
(providers),&quot; said Michael Novikov, marketing manager for St. <br />
Petersburg software developer Arcadia Inc., in an interview with The <br />
Industry Standard computer magazine. &quot;(Providers) will also likely <br />
lose some corporate users because of fears over insecure data <br />
exchange, perhaps through the possibility that the FSB would reveal <br />
or sell corporate secrets.&quot; One way around SORM-2 is the use of <br />
encryption programs. Legal experts disagree on whether private <br />
individuals or companies in Russia can encode their e-mails and other <br />
electronic correspondence, but Levenchuk, who has looked into it thoroughly, <br />
insists it is legal.
</p><p>And already people are turning to encryption. Maxim Otstanov, the <br />
host of the Russian version of a U.S-based web site that offers the <br />
commonly used encryption program Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, says <br />
that since the news of SORM-2 was first leaked by Levenchuk in the <br />
summer, the number of hits to his web site have more than doubled.
</p><p>You remember the KGB, don&#39;t you?&quot; said Yury Vdovin, deputy <br />
chairman of Citizens&#39; Watch, a St. Petersburg-based human-rights <br />
group. &quot;They&#39;re used to collecting dossiers on citizens, just in <br />
case. They collected, collect and will continue to collect <br />
information on us. Now they&#39;re asking me to pay extra so they can tap <br />
me at an even higher quality?&quot; As Vdovin&#39;s comment suggests, there <br />
seems to be a natural alliance between Internet providers and <br />
human-rights activists against SORM-2. But appearances can be <br />
deceptive: No such alliance has materialized, and the two groups are <br />
often suspicious of each other.
</p><p>Human-rights activists complain that providers are too <br />
FSB-friendly as is - and allege that providers themselves are already <br />
running their own mini-SORM -style operations, storing years worth of <br />
their clients&#39; old e-mails.
</p><p>At a Citizens&#39; Watch conference on privacy held last month in St. <br />
Petersburg, Ivan Seckey of the Open Society Institute at the Central <br />
European University in Budapest said that Russian Internet service <br />
providers could be doing much more to fight the FSB.
</p><p>&quot;They should delete all transmissions immediately, so the FSB <br />
can&#39;t force them to hand over information by threatening to revoke <br />
their licenses,&quot; Seckey said. &quot;They don&#39;t do this now because they <br />
need the benevolence of the authorities, and also because they use <br />
certain information for marketing purposes.&quot; Providers concede that <br />
they store information about a client&#39;s Internet activity - that is <br />
how they keep track of &quot;hits&quot; on certain web sites, and assemble <br />
information about those hits by demographic factors, which is <br />
important to advertisers and would-be advertisers on a certain web <br />
site. And they concede that e-mails get stored along with that <br />
information, because the programs that track Internet activity don&#39;t <br />
differentiate between different kinds of activity - it all just gets <br />
sent into the memory banks.
</p><p>But beyond that, providers say the human-rights activists often <br />
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. And they also say they are <br />
afraid to stand up to the FSB and Goskomsvyaz because the state can <br />
pull their licenses. Given that FSB power over their fate, it&#39;s not <br />
surprising that many providers disdain the fiery talk of the human <br />
rights and privacy rights activists, and instead try to speak carefully <br />
of SORM-2 - as a narrow business dispute with the FSB <br />
over who will pay for it.
</p><p>&quot;There is no conflict now (over SORM-2),&quot; said Andrei Sibrant, <br />
director of Moscow&#39;s Glasnet. &quot;When the FSB comes to me with specific <br />
documents detailing what technology I need to install and how much I <br />
will have to pay for it, then there will be a massive conflict. Until <br />
then there is no reason for human rights groups who know nothing <br />
about the business to provoke a conflict.&quot; Andrei Sorokin, executive <br />
director of St. Petersburg&#39;s Peterlink, offered a similar view. &quot;I <br />
will not, I repeat, will not buy this equipment for the FSB. This is <br />
ridiculous. We&#39;ll have to pass along this cost to the customers. <br />
We&#39;re in the middle of a crisis and they can barely afford the <br />
Internet as it is,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. But if that <br />
sounded combative, Sorokin&#39;s rhetoric is, like that of many other <br />
providers, simply the opening bid: &quot;When the time comes, we will band <br />
together and fight. They can&#39;t close down an entire market. But until <br />
then, there is nothing to fight.&quot; Levenchuk, the Internet analyst who <br />
first spoke about SORM-2 on his web site, has long been trying to <br />
organize opposition to it. It has been an uphill slog - in no small <br />
part because Internet service providers themselves are rarely eager <br />
to stand up to the FSB. &quot;Usually providers are more FSB-friendly than <br />
the public thinks,&quot; Levenchuk said.
</p><p>The same complaint comes from Yevgeny Prygov of Krasnodar, who <br />
was working with Levenchuk as the coordinator of an official <br />
anti-SORM movement with its own web site, <a href="http://www.antisorm.df.ru/">www.antisorm.df.ru</a>.
</p><p>&quot;Well, the movement was a good idea but the movement has been <br />
broken,&quot; Prygov said in an e-mail interview last week. &quot;It lacks the <br />
interest of (Internet service provider) executives.&quot; &quot;The crisis in <br />
Russia has redefined some of the priorities and the Anti-SORM <br />
movement is one of the victims of this process,&quot; Prygov continued. <br />
&quot;People are thinking about how to stay alive and they forget the <br />
value of freedom.&quot; In fact, about the only thing Prygov&#39;s anti-SORM <br />
movement seems to have done was set up a web site, announce itself - <br />
and disband.
</p><p>&quot;No steps were taken - only talks,&quot; Prygov admitted. &quot;Everyone is <br />
so afraid. I don&#39;t have a family but even I alone cannot go without <br />
work for a month and expect to eat. We have to be careful to survive. <br />
We have no reserves. The standard of living here is not to be <br />
compared to that in Moscow or St. Petersburg.&quot; But even in Moscow, <br />
the standard of living is no picnic for the unemployed. Membership in <br />
the anti-SORM resistance movement has crumbled just as quickly here.
</p><p>&quot;They lasted all of five minutes,&quot; Levenchuk said. &quot;The FSB <br />
usually wins these things.&quot; The Internet service provider Data Force <br />
was one of two Moscow companies that tentatively decided to oppose <br />
SORM-2.&quot;After we had a discussion we decided to (join the) protest,&quot; <br />
said Sergei Domatov, Data Force&#39;s assistant director. &quot;Afterward the <br />
FSB contacted us, and we decided at this point there is nothing to <br />
fight about. The FSB is doing their job, and we are doing ours.&quot; If <br />
providers seem quick to fold, in part that&#39;s because they have long <br />
ago learned the futility of arguing with the FSB. Even before SORM-2 <br />
the FSB has been known to request access to e-mails and other <br />
information - with or without a court order.
</p><p>Peterlink is one of many providers where company officials can <br />
recount a visit from FSB agents who refused to present a warrant.
</p><p>&quot;We refused to give them information, but they&#39;re professional,&quot; <br />
said Sorokin of Peterlink. &quot;They threaten to revoke our operating <br />
license. We want to protect our clients&#39; rights - but we also have to <br />
protect our business. Everyone is afraid.&quot; &quot;The FSB comes to <br />
providers here and says simply, &#39;We want full access to all e-mail <br />
traffic of your clients.&#39; We ask for a warrant or court order, they <br />
don&#39;t have one, but they have the power in every structure in the <br />
province and (providers) surrender to stay alive,&quot; said Prygov of the <br />
anti-SORM movement.
</p><p>To date, only one provider has refused to conform to SORM-2 <br />
regulations. Since last April, Oleg Sirov of Volgograd-based <br />
Bayard-Slavia Communications has repeatedly refused to cooperate with <br />
FSB requests for information, demanding first to see a warrant. He <br />
has also refused to foot the bill for the required technology.
</p><p>But in telephone interviews from Volgograd, officials at <br />
Bayard-Slavia Communications say they have recently been threatened <br />
by the FSB with losing their license. They also say they have faced a <br />
tax police audit that turned up nothing but was harrowing just the <br />
same. Watching from Moscow, Levenchuk says of his friends at <br />
Bayard-Slavia, &quot;I am afraid that the official reason for withdrawing <br />
their license will not be related to SORM-2.&quot; Boris Pustintsev, <br />
chairman of St. Petersburg-based Citizens&#39; Watch, said he was <br />
pessimistic about the chances of an anti-SORM resistance movement <br />
among providers.
</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say that they will probably only be successful in <br />
going broke,&quot; he said.
</p><p>But Pustintsev added that if more than half of all providers were <br />
to unite, then with the backing of human rights groups they could <br />
succeed.
</p><p>&quot;We will broadcast (news of the battle) throughout the world. The <br />
FSB can&#39;t close them all down. That would be a scandal of <br />
international proportion and Russia can&#39;t have that right now,&quot; <br />
Pustintsev said.
</p><p>Citizens&#39; Watch has set a self-imposed deadline of June to draft <br />
proposals, to be read in the State Duma, the lower house of <br />
parliament, on creating a system of checks and balances on SORM-2.
</p><p>One such proposal described by Vdovin would involve giving a <br />
&quot;key&quot; to the FSB computers receiving information from SORM-2 black <br />
boxes and hotlines to an independent third party. That key would only <br />
be loaned to the FSB when its agents can produce a court order; the <br />
third party would also keep a log of all FSB SORM-2 eavesdropping <br />
activity.
</p><p>But human rights and privacy activists are quick to add that <br />
SORM-2 raises fundamental questions about freedom that can&#39;t be <br />
solved with a few laws and clever ideas.
</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a problem of educating the people - starting from the <br />
ground up,&quot; Levenchuk said. &quot;It&#39;s no use fighting the FSB when no one <br />
understands what the fight is for.&quot; Christopher Hamilton and Bradley <br />
Cook contributed to this report.
